## Welcome to the INTERACT RStudio Cloud

You can securely analyse your data and upload your code to Github using the INTERACT RStudio Cloud. 

## Setup process

1. Connect with Jeff to so your IP address can be whitelisted and we can create an account for you. 
2. You will received an web address, username, and password from INTERACT. You will need those. 
3. Go the web address using your web browser. It will look something like this.

### Troubleshooting Login

1. If the website is just spinning and you don't see the login? 
    - Your IP is probably not whitelisted. Check with staff. 
    - Compute Canada Arbutus may be down? Check the Compute Canada Server status [https://status.computecanada.ca/](https://status.computecanada.ca/)

# RStudio Setup

RStudio will run like it normally does locally on your PC. You can create new markdown files and R projects. A few tips: 

1. Keep a code chuck with the necessary libraries to run your code at the top of your file. This is standard practice. You can install packages like you normally would. You only need to install packages once. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(usethis)
```

# Getting the data

Data are stored in `/var/interact_data/`. You can't see the files locally like you would on your computer. Use `list.files` and `list.dir` to find the files. 

```{r}
list.files(path = "/var/interact_data")
```

Now you have a list of files. You can read the files like your normally would. Let's say we want to read in the Victoria Table of Power file. 

```{r}
vic_w1_top <- read_csv("/var/interact_data/victoria_01_table_of_power_2020-01-10.csv")
```

# Configuring Git

If you want to configuring Git and connect with Github you can use functions from the `usethis` package. Let's say you have created a repo in Github and are comfortable with the [https://happygitwithr.com/](https://happygitwithr.com/) stuff. 

1. Configure your user level Github credentials with `use_git_config`.

```{r}
use_git_config(
  scope = "user",
  user.name = "YOUR_USERNAME",
  user.email = "YOUR_EMAIL"
)
```

1. Create a repo on Github
2. Create an R Project in the RStudio cloud environment and connect it with the repo you created in 1
3. RStudio will prompt you for your username and password
4. Work like you normally would
    - **Never post data to Github**
