## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

install.packages("usethis")
library(usethis)

use_git_config(
  scope = "user",
  user.name = "walkabilly",
  user.email = "fuller.daniel@gmail.com"
)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
df <- read_csv("/var/interact_data/vancouver_01_top_1min_2020-01-10.csv")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
